Open Hypergraphs are a general, differentiable and data-parallel datastructure for syntax. Here’s a few examples of suitable uses:

- Differentiable array programs for deep learning (in [catgrad][catgrad]).
- Proofs and terms in first order logic
- Programs in the λ-calculus
- Circuits with feedback

This code is an implementation of the paper
[Data-Parallel Algorithms for String Diagrams](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.01041).

# Features

- An imperative interface
  for constructing open hypergraphs in Rust
  the [lax module](https://docs.rs/open-hypergraphs/latest/open_hypergraphs/lax/index.html))
- Data-parallel algorithms for algebraic operations
  (the [strict module](https://docs.rs/open-hypergraphs/latest/open_hypergraphs/strict/index.html))
- Data-parallel diagram layering and decomposition
- Functors, including optic transformation for ahead-of-time differentiation of
  syntax

# Examples

An example for defining a simple expression language ([polynomial
circuits](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352220823000469))
and evaluating its terms is given [here](./examples/polycirc.rs).

A complete example showing term construction, rendering as SVG using [open-hypergraphs-dot][oh-dot], and
serialization to JSON can be found [here](./examples/serde/).
This example produces the following open hypergraph:

![image](./images/subtract.svg)

which serializes to JSON as below:

```json
{
    "sources": [3,0],
    "targets": [4],
    "hypergraph": {
        "nodes":[
            {"Interval":{"lower":0,"upper":1}},
            "Int","Int","Int","Int"
        ],
        "edges": ["Cast","Neg","Add"],
        "adjacency": [
            {"sources":[0],"targets":[1]},
            {"sources":[1],"targets":[2]},
            {"sources":[3,2],"targets":[4]}
        ],
        "quotient":[[],[]]
    }
}
```
